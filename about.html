                        <p><q>I began my IT career in 2010, working help desk jobs and Support Specialist projects throughout Texas. I didnâ€™t feel comfortable with the order of tech companies and embarked on the greatest entrepreneurial adventure of my life. I packed my bags and begun traveling the world starting from Warsaw, Poland to Istanbul, Turkey and most recent Bangkok, Thailand. I lived and worked as a TEFL/ESL Teacher broadening my business connections, experience as an English Teacher, Writer, Software Developer, Language Foundation and World Marketing. The experience was incredible and provided not only mental and directional clarity but offered a broadening in cultural perspective that has left me with a hunger for working with as many outside sources as possible and to continue sharpening my skills in all interests both professional and characteristic. The ultimate goal is to create a foundation that gives back to the community from where I came.</q> - Founder and CEO Christian D. Resendez</p>
